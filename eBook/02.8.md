#2.8 Summary
In this chapter, we mainly introduced 25 keywords in Go, let's what they are and what they do.

	break    default      func    interface    select
	case     defer        go      map          struct
	chan     else         goto    package      switch
	const    fallthrough  if      range        type
	continue for          import  return       var
	
- `var` and `const` is to define variables and constants.
- `package` and `import` is for package use.
- `func` is to define functions and methods.
- `return` it to return values in functions or methods.
- `defer` is to define defer functions.
- `go` it to start a new goroutine.
- `select` is to select many channels for communication.
- `interface` is to define interfaces.
- `struct` is to define special customized types.
- `break`, `case`, `continue`, `for`, `fallthrough`, `else`, `if`, `switch`, `goto`, `default` was introduced in section 2.3.
- `chan` is the type of channel for communication among goroutines.
- `type` is to define customized types.
- `map` is to define map which is like hash table in others languages.
- `range` is for reading data from `slice`, `map` and `channel`.

If you understand how to use these 25 keywords, you've known very much Go already.
