#2.1 Hello, Go
Before we start building an application, we need to learn how to write a simple program. It's like you cannot build a building without knowing how to build its ground. Therefore, we are going to learn the basic syntax to run simple programs in this section.

##Program
According to internaional practice, before you learn how to progrmming in some languages, you should know how to write a program to print "hello world".

Are you ready? Let's Go!

	package main
	
	import "fmt"
	
	func main() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello, world or 你好，世界 or καλημ ́ρα κóσμ or こんにちは世界\n")
	}
	
It will print following information.

	Hello, world or 你好，世界 or καλημ ́ρα κóσμ or こんにちは世界
	
##Explanation
One thing you should know in the first is that Go programs are composed by `package`.

`package<pkgName>` (In this case is `package main`) tells us this source file belongs to `main` package, and the `main` keyword tells us this package will be compiled to a program instead of package files with extension `.a`.

Every executable program has and only has one `main` package, and you need a entry function called `main` without any argument and return value in `main` package.

In order to print `Hello, world…`, we called a function called `Printf`, this function is coming from `fmt` package, so we import this package in the third line of source code, which is `import "fmt"`

The way that packages in Go is like Python, there are some advantages: Modularity(break up your program into many modules) and reusability(every module can be reused in mamy programs). We just talk about concepts about packages, we will make our own packages later.

In fifth line, we use keyword `func` to define the `main` function, body is inside of `{}`, just like C, C++ and Java.

As you can see, there is no argument, we will learn how to write functions with arguments, have no return value and have several return values soon.

In sixth line, we called function `Printf` which in package `fmt`. This was called by format `<pkgName>.<funcName>`, which is very like Python-style.

As we metioned in chapter 1, package's name and the name of folder that contains that package can be different. Here the `<pkgName>` comes from the name in `package <pkgName>`, not the folder's name.

you may notice that in the example that I showed you above contains mamy non-ASCII characters. The purpose of showing is telling you that Go supports UTF-8 by default, you can use any UTF-8 character in your programs. 

##Conclusion
Go uses `package` (like modules in Python) to organize programs. The function `main.main()` (this function must be in the `main` package) is the entry point of any program. Go supports UTF-8 characters because one of the founder of Go is the founder of UTF-8, so Go supoorts multi-language by the time it was born.
