##interface
The subtlest design in Go should be the interface. After you read this section, you will be subdued by this design.

###What is interface
In short, interface is a set of methods, we use interface to define a set of actions.

Like the example in previous section, both Student and Employee can `SayHi`, but they don't do the same thing.

Let's do more work, we add one more method `Sing` to them, also add BorrowMoney to Student and SpendSalary to Employee.

Now Student has three method called SayHi, Sing, BorrowMoney, and Employee has SayHi, Sing and SpendSalary.

This combination of methods called interface, implemented by Student and Employee. So Student and Employee implement interface: SayHi, Sing. At the same time, Employee doesn't implement interface: SayHi, Sing, BorrowMoney, and Student doesn't implement interface: SayHi, Sing, SpendSalary. The reason is that Employee doesn't have method BorrowMoney and Student doesn't have mothod SpendSalary.

###Type of interface
Interface defines a set of methods, if a type implements all the methods we say that it implements the interface.

	type Human struct {
    	name string
    	age int
    	phone string
	}

	type Student struct {
    	Human
    	school string
    	loan float32
	}

	type Employee struct {
    	Human
    	company string
    	money float32
	}

	func (h *Human) SayHi() {
    	fmt.Printf("Hi, I am %s you can call me on %s\n", h.name, h.phone)
	}

	func (h *Human) Sing(lyrics string) {
    	fmt.Println("La la, la la la, la la la la la...", lyrics)
	}

	func (h *Human) Guzzle(beerStein string) {
    	fmt.Println("Guzzle Guzzle Guzzle...", beerStein)
	}

	// Employee overloads Sayhi
	func (e *Employee) SayHi() {
    	fmt.Printf("Hi, I am %s, I work at %s. Call me on %s\n", e.name,
        	e.company, e.phone) //Yes you can split into 2 lines here.
	}

	func (s *Student) BorrowMoney(amount float32) {
    	s.loan += amount // (again and again and...)
	}

	func (e *Employee) SpendSalary(amount float32) {
    	e.money -= amount // More vodka please!!! Get me through the day!
	}

	// define interface
	type Men interface {
    	SayHi()
    	Sing(lyrics string)
    	Guzzle(beerStein string)
	}

	type YoungChap interface {
    	SayHi()
    	Sing(song string)
    	BorrowMoney(amount float32)
	}

	type ElderlyGent interface {
    	SayHi()
    	Sing(song string)
    	SpendSalary(amount float32)
	}

We know that interface can be implemented by any type, and one type can implement many interfaces at the same time.

Noted that any type implements the empty interface `interface{}` because it doesn't have any mothed and all types have zero method as default.

###Value of interface
So what kind of values can be put in the interface? If we define a variable as type interface, any type that implements the interface can assign to this variable.

Like the above example, if we define a varibale m as interface Men, then one of the Student, Human or Employee can assign to m. So we could have a slice of Men, any type that implemnets interface Men can assign to this slice, but be aware that the slice of intercase doesn't have same behaviour as slice of other types.

	package main
	import "fmt"

	type Human struct {
    	name string
    	age int
    	phone string
	}

	type Student struct {
    	Human 
    	school string
    	loan float32
	}

	type Employee struct {
    	Human 
    	company string
    	money float32
	}

	func (h Human) SayHi() {
    	fmt.Printf("Hi, I am %s you can call me on %s\n", h.name, h.phone)
	}

	func (h Human) Sing(lyrics string) {
    	fmt.Println("La la la la...", lyrics)
	}

	func (e Employee) SayHi() {
    	fmt.Printf("Hi, I am %s, I work at %s. Call me on %s\n", e.name,
        	e.company, e.phone) //Yes you can split into 2 lines here.
    }

	// Interface Men implemented by Human, Student and Employee	
	type Men interface {
    	SayHi()
    	Sing(lyrics string)
	}

	func main() {
    	mike := Student{Human{"Mike", 25, "222-222-XXX"}, "MIT", 0.00}
    	paul := Student{Human{"Paul", 26, "111-222-XXX"}, "Harvard", 100}
    	sam := Employee{Human{"Sam", 36, "444-222-XXX"}, "Golang Inc.", 1000}
    	Tom := Employee{Human{"Sam", 36, "444-222-XXX"}, "Things Ltd.", 5000}

    	// define interface i
    	var i Men

    	//i can store Student
    	i = mike
    	fmt.Println("This is Mike, a Student:")
    	i.SayHi()
    	i.Sing("November rain")

    	//i can store Employee
    	i = Tom
    	fmt.Println("This is Tom, an Employee:")
    	i.SayHi()
    	i.Sing("Born to be wild")

    	// slice of Men
    	fmt.Println("Let's use a slice of Men and see what happens")
    	x := make([]Men, 3)
    	// these three elements are different types but they all implemented interface Men
    	x[0], x[1], x[2] = paul, sam, mike

    	for _, value := range x{
        	value.SayHi()
    	}
	}
	
Interface is a set of abstract methods, it can be implemented by ono-interface types, so it cannot implement itself.

###Empty interface
Empty interface is the interface that doesn't contain any method, so all types implemented empty interface. It's very useful when we want to store all types at some point, it's like void* in C.

	// define a as empty interface
	var a interface{}
	var i int = 5
	s := "Hello world"
	// a can store value of any type
	a = i
	a = s

If a function uses empty interface as its argument type, it can accept any type; if a function uses empty as its return value type, it can return any type.
