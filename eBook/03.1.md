#Web working principles
Every time you open your browsers, type some URLs and press enter, then beautiful web pages appear on you sreen. Do you know what behind this simple action?

Normally, your browser is a client, after you typed URL, it sends requests to DNS server, get IP address of the URL. Then it finds the server in that IP address, asks to setup TCP connections. When the browser finished sending HTTP requests, server starts handling your request packages, then return HTTP response packages to your browser. Finally, the browser renders body of the web page, and disconnects from server.

A web server also known as HTTP server, it uses HTTP protocol to communicate with clients. All web browsers can be clients.

We can divid web working principles to following steps:

- Client uses TCP/IP protocol to connect to server.
- Client sends HTTP request packages to server.
- Server returns HTTP response packages to client, if request resources including dynamic scripts, server calls script engine first.
- Client disconnects from server, starts rendering HTML.

This a simple work flow of HTTP tasks, notice that every time server closes connections after sent data to client, and waits for next request.

##URL and DNS resolution
We are always using URL to access web pages, but do you know how URL works?

The full name of URL is Uniform Resource Locator, this is for describling resources on the internet. Its basic forms as follows.

	scheme://host[:port#]/path/.../[?query-string][#anchor]
	scheme         assign underlying protocol(例如：http, https, ftp)
	host           IP or domain name of HTTP server
	port#          default port is 80, and you can omit in this case. If you want to use other ports, you must to specify which port. For example, http://www.cnblogs.com:8080/
	path           resources path
	query-string   data are sent to server
	anchor         anchor
	
DNS is abbreviation of Domain Name System, it's the name system for computer network services, it converts domain name to actual IP addresses. It's like a translator.

Figure 3.2 DNS working principle

To understand more about its working principle, let's see detailed DNS resolution process as follows.

1. After typed domain name www.qq.com in the browser, operating system will check if there is any mapping relationship in the hosts file for this domain name, if so then finished the domain name resolution.
2. If no mapping relationship in the hosts file, operating system will check if there is any cache in the DNS, if so then finished the domain name resolution.
3. If no mapping relationship in the hosts and DNS cache, operating system finds the first DNS resolition server in your TCP/IP setting, which is local DNS server at this time. When local DNS server received query, if the domain name that you want to query is contained in the local configuration of resional resources, then gives back results to the client. This DNS resolution is authoritative.
4. If local DNS server doesn't contain the domain name, and there is a mapping relationship in the cache, local DNS server gives back this result to client. This DNS resolution is not authoritative.
5. If local DNS server cannot resolve this domain name either by configuration of regional resource or cache, it gets into next step depends on the local DNS server setting. If the local DNS server doesn't enable forward mode, it sends request to root DNS server, then returns the IP of top level DNS server may know this domain name, .com in this case. If the first top level DNS server doesn't know, it sends request to next top level DNS server until the one that knows the domain name. Then the top level DNS server asks next level DNS server for qq.com, then finds the www.qq.com in some servers. 
6. If the local DNS server enabled forward mode, it sends request to upper level DNS server, if the upper level DNS server also doesn't know the domain name, then keep sending request to upper level. Whether local DNS server enables forward mode, server's IP address of domain name returns to local DNS server, and local server sends it to clients.

`Recursive query process` means the enquirers are changing in the process, and enquieres do not change in `Iterative query process`.

Now we know clients get IP addresses in the end, so the browsers are communicating with servers by IP addresses.

##HTTP protocol
HTTP protocol is the core part of web services. It's important to know waht is HTTP protocol before you understand how web works.
