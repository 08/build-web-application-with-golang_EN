#2.3 Control statements and functions
In this section, we are goning to talk about control statements and function operation in Go.

##Control statement
The greastet inventions in programming language is flow control. Because of them, you are able to use simple control statements represent complex logic. There are three categories, conditional, cycle control and unconditional jump.

###if
`if` should be the most common keyword in your programs. If it meets the condtions then does something, does something else if not.

`if` doesn't need parentheses in Go.

	if x > 10 {
    	fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
	} else {
    	fmt.Println("x is less than 10")
	} 
	
The most useful thing of `if` in Go is that it can contains one initialization statement before the conditional statement. The scope of variables which are defined in this initialization statement is only in the block of `if`.

	// initialize x, then check if x greater than 
	if x := computedValue(); x > 10 {
    	fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
	} else {
    	fmt.Println("x is less than 10")
	}

	// the following code will not compile
	fmt.Println(x)
	
Use if-else for multiple conditions.

	if integer == 3 {
    	fmt.Println("The integer is equal to 3")
	} else if integer < 3 {
    	fmt.Println("The integer is less than 3")
	} else {
    	fmt.Println("The integer is greater than 3")
	}
	
###goto
Go has `goto`, but be careful when you use it. `goto` have to jump to the `label` that in the body of same function.

	func myFunc() {
    	i := 0
	Here:   // lable ends with ":"
    	println(i)
    	i++
    	goto Here   // jump to lebale "Here"
	}
	
Label name is case sensitive.

###for
`for` is the most powerful control logic in Go, it can read data in loops and iterative operations, just like `while`.

	for expression1; expression2; expression3 {
    	//...
	}
	
`expression1`, `expression2` and `expression3` are all expressions obviously, where `expression1` and `expression3` are variable defination or return values from functions, and `expression2` is a conditional statment. `expression1` will be exectured before the loop, and `expression3` will be after.

An example is more useful than hundreds of words.

	package main
	import "fmt"

	func main(){
    	sum := 0;
    	for index:=0; index < 10 ; index++ {
        	sum += index
    	}
    	fmt.Println("sum is equal to ", sum)
	}
	// Print：sum is equal to 45

Sometimes we need multiple assignments, but Go doesn't have operator `,`, so we use parallel assginment like `i, j = i + 1, j - 1`.

We can omit `expression1` and `expression3` if they are not necessary.

	sum := 1
	for ; sum < 1000;  {
    	sum += sum
	}
	
Omit `;` as well. Feel familiar? Yes, it's `while`.

	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
    	sum += sum
	}
	
There are two important operations in loops which are `break` and `continue`. `break` jumps out the loop, and `continue` skips current loop and starts next one. If you have nested loops, use `break` with labels together.

	for index := 10; index>0; index-- {
    	if index == 5{
        	break // 或者continue
    	}
    	fmt.Println(index)
	}
	// break prints 10、9、8、7、6
	// continue prints 10、9、8、7、6、4、3、2、1
	
`for` could read data from `slice` and `map` when it is used with `range`.

	for k,v:=range map {
    	fmt.Println("map's key:",k)
    	fmt.Println("map's val:",v)
	}
	
Because Go support multi-value return and gives compile errors when you don't use values that was defined, so you may want to use `_` to discard some return values. 

	for _, v := range map{
    	fmt.Println("map's val:", v)
	}
